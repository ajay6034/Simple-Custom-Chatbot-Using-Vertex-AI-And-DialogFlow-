## Custom ChatBot On Specific LLM Research Papers Using gemini-1.5-flash-002 Base Model

## Project Explination
- This project demonstrates a simple, interactive chatbot application leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) i.e., gemini-1.5-flash-002 Base Model Using Vertex AI and Dailogflow. 
- Here I have used Cloud storage for storing the custom dataset by creating a bucket 

## Technologies Used
- Dialogflow: A natural language understanding (NLU) platform for designing and integrating conversational user interfaces into web and mobile applications. It powers the chatbot's conversation handling and intent recognition.
- Vertex AI: A unified AI platform in GCP for building, training, and deploying custom machine learning models. In this project, Vertex AI can:
Enhance the chatbot's responses by integrating custom-trained ML models.
- Serve as the backend for advanced tasks such as intent disambiguation or contextual recommendations.

## The frontend webpage for the chatbot, featuring:
- I used Flask which provides an easy way to define routes for your application.
- Styling: Designed with CSS for a modern and user-friendly interface.
- Dialogflow Integration: Embedded Dialogflow messenger for chatbot interactions.
- Customizable Chat UI: Includes custom styles for user and bot messages.
